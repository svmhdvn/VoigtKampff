    <string name="helpFirst">The year is 2014.  This app is the first working prototype for the earliest version of the Voigt-Kampff empathy test, used to determine whether a subject is an android or not.  It uses a subject\'s reaction time, as well as his/her/its competence in choosing the correct answers for the test\'s questions, in order to rate an individual on his/her/its authenticity as a human being.  Further development is being conducted to implement face recognition and motion detection technology to improve the precision and accuracy of the test.</string>
    <string name="helpSecond">This test will ask and describe a total of eight questions and situations respectively that are meant to register an empathetic response in you.  These questions are the first to be validated out of a bank of thousands of questions (further research is being conducted to speed up the process of validation), hence they appear in this working prototype. Choose the *most* correct answer out of a choice of four as quickly as possible.  Your reaction time will be measured, along with the empathic rating of each chosen answer.  Finally, the test will determine your authenticity (or syntheticity) as a human being.</string>
